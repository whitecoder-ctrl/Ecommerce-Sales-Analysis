This repository contains the full data analysis project for a Superstore e-commerce dataset, designed to identify key drivers of profitability and provide actionable recommendations to management.

This project serves as a portfolio piece for my data analysis services on Upwork.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Analysis Skills:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis, Time-Series Analysis, Data Visualization

## 📈 Key Findings & Actionable Recommendations

This analysis uncovered significant insights into the company's financial performance.

### Key Findings
1.  **Negative Correlation:** A strong negative correlation (-0.22) exists between **Discount** and **Profit**. Discounts above 20-30% almost always result in a financial loss.
2.  **Regional Discrepancy:** The **Central Region** is a critical problem area, ranking high in sales but lowest in profit, indicating severe discount mismanagement.
3.  **Product Losses:** The **Furniture** category, specifically **"Tables"** and **"Bookcases"**, are the largest drivers of financial loss.

### Actionable Recommendations
1.  **Discount Strategy Overhaul:** Implement a hard cap on discounts, especially for items in the Furniture category (max 20%).
2.  **Product Assortment Optimization:** Re-evaluate or discontinue the sale of "Tables" and "Bookcases" in unprofitable regions like Central.
3.  **Regional Policy Review:** Conduct an immediate review of the sales strategy and discount policies in the **Central Region**.
